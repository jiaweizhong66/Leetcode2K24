# Introduction

As I am graduating in Fall 2025, this is my journey to prepare for my tech interviews. With graduation approaching in April 2025, I will take my tech interview preparation seriously for the first time. This project aims to tackle LeetCode problems in a much more organized way.

# Goals

Structured Preparation: I will systematically work through coding problems, ensuring that I cover a broad range of topics relevant to technical interviews.
Language Focus: Most of the coding will be done in Java and C++, with some JavaScript solutions as well.
