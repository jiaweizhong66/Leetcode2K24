# Squared Array

[Leetcode #977](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/description/)

You are given a sort array in descend order. nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10], you need to square all elements [16,1,0,9,100] and return the
array in descent order as well, so we need to return [0,1,9,16,100]

For this question, we also have brute force and double pointers.
