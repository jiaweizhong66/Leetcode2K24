# Removing Element Introduction

Question: Give you an array nums, and a int val. Remove all elements equal to the val and return the length of the new array.
Do not use extra space for array, you must only use extra O(1)

Element sequence can change, you dont need to worry about elements exceeding the length of the new array.

If nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3, then 2 should be returned and first two elements of the array should be 2 as 3 are "removed"

Two methods: Brute force and two pointers.
